/// (design §3). Every merge rule lives here so it is unit-testable
/// without a GUI:
///
/// - 同一 Run 只出现一次：a run referenced by attention items is shown
///   ONLY in 需要关注 and is removed from 进行中 / 最近完成.
/// - 异常优先排序：the attention section is the first section
///   (`sectionOrder`); within a section cards keep the engine's stable
///   identity order.
/// - Attention for a run missing from both lists (e.g. a terminal
///   failed run) still gets a synthetic card — attention facts are
///   never dropped, and the synthetic status is 未知状态, never a
///   guessed terminal state (design §4).
/// - Current-plan progress and all-revision consumption ride along as
///   SEPARATE fields (`run.progress` vs `run.consumption`); there is no
///   combined value (`combinedProgressConsumpletion` stays nil) and no
///   percentage is fabricated.
/// - Lifecycle layering (G011): which SECTION a run lands in is the
///   ENGINE's classification (a cancelled Goal's runs arrive in no
///   current list); the Goal control layer travels beside the run
///   status as `controlStatus` — two dimensions, never rewritten.
